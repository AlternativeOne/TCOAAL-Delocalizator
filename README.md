# TCOAAL-Delocalizator
To run 'TCOAAL' on any other platform than Windows you need to decrypt it using IelmenDecryptor. But it still will error about missing localization since you also need to insert phrases from localization file into Map****.json files. 

So, this script will do it for you.
To run it you need to:
1) Decrypt game using IelmenDecryptor
2) Get dialogue.csv of needed language (using Translation Tool from game package or by downloading one from other localization) (but consider that default game phrases, like menus and else, will still be in English since they are hardcoded in Map****.json for some reason)
3) Change pathes in script itself
4) Run script
